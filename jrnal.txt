Day 1 : 

		Chapter 1 :

		-Use cntrl shift P for command window.
		-![tab] to create default .html template.
		-Use keyboard shortcuts to save time.
		-statements/expressions
		-code is case-sensitive, this is a big cause of bugs
		-white space is ignored.
		
		1. Helloworld Jscript Cmd
			let normalName = 'Quinn';
			let javaScriptName = normalName + 'Script';
			console.log('Your Javascript Name is ' + JavaScriptName);
			!WARNING USE ENTER AFTER EACH LINE OF CODE. UNDEFINED IS ACCEPTABLE IN CONSOLE MODE.
			
		-Use cntrl shift J in browser to open up the console on chrome.
		
		2. Button Browserprompt .html cmd;
			<button onclick="alert('Welcome to Javascript All-In-One, Hello World')">
			Click here for an important message
			</button>
			
		- (2.) is uncommon, it's a limited command and it's not considered an attractive option in executing a javascript command.
		- (2.) runs with a higher scope (unsure what this means as of yet), this can break with more complex jscript operations.
		
		3. Running Javascript commands (html inline method in <body> )
			<script>
			let personName = prompt('What is your name, user?');
			alert('Hello, ' + personName);
			</script>
			
		- Seperation of concerns informs that programs shall be seperated into different sections. You shouldn't mix your presentation code (HTML) with logic code (JavaScript).
		- (3.) is an unrealistic example because as previously implied, this is not a viable way of executing complex code and it's convoluted.
		- the index.html file notates the folder containing it as the root directory.
		
		4. First Javascript .js file, gamelet.js
				const ball = document.getElementById('ball')
			document.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyPress);
			let position = 0;

			function handleKeyPress(e) {
				if (e.code === 'ArrowLeft') {
					position = position - 10;
				}
				if (e.code === 'ArrowRight') {
				position = position + 10;
				}
				if (position < 0) {
				position = 0;
				}
			refresh();
			}
			function refresh() {
				ball.style.left = position + 'px';
			}
			
		Chapter 2 :
		
		"As a cook, your station, and its condition, its state of readiness, is an extension of your nervous system."
		- Use // to note lines of code.
		- Use /* */ to block off lines of code.
